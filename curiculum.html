<h2>The Bit<a class="headerlink" href="#the-bit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Make a One-bit memory.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m seriously here, your first lesson is to make a device, no matter how
simple, that stores one bit. It can be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A coin, flip heads for 1, tails for 0.</li>
<li>A match, horizontal or vertical, head up or head down...</li>
<li>A short length of string, knotted for 0, untied for 1.</li>
<li>A rubber-band, knotted for 1, unknotted for 0.</li>
<li>A business card, horiz. v. vert., front v. back, bent v. straightened.</li>
<li>Even a light switch from a hardware store.</li>
</ul>
<p>Literally any binary &#8220;storage&#8221; scheme could be accepted, as long as the
student truly gets the arbitrary mapping from a physical phenomenon to a
binary digit. I am convinced that doing this physically, with real world
objects, is crucial. Take your time here, don&#8217;t rush. The binary digit is
a deep sucker, it just seems so plain on first brush. (Hint: What is the
least &#8220;stuff&#8221; you need to make a bit? Sample rate and resolution... What
the heck &#8220;is&#8221; a bit anyway? You can&#8217;t carry it, but you can transmit it,
what&#8217;s up with that? And you can duplicate it? Huh?)</p>

<h2>Line up eight of them. Make a byte.<a class="headerlink" href="#line-up-eight-of-them-make-a-byte" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once you&#8217;ve made a bit-store, the next lesson involves lining them up and
flipping them on and off.</p>
<p>Count the states, number them, talk about:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>n-to-the-power-of-two</li>
<li>Grey Codes</li>
<li>I Ching</li>
<li>distinguishable states</li>
<li>Boolean logic</li>
<li>all the deep meanings already present in more-than-one-bit-ness. (Twenty Questions!)</li>
</ul>
<p>Make concrete the Octet, aka Byte, mention ASCII, signed and unsigned
&#8220;short&#8221; ints, Unicode and encodings (to bytes) and thence sixteen-bit and
larger words.</p>

<h2>Stack up a bunch of bytes. Make RAM.<a class="headerlink" href="#stack-up-a-bunch-of-bytes-make-ram" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Take some bytes, at least a dozen, and stack them in a column. Count
the bytes, introduce the count as naming or indexing the bytes, call it
RAM.</li>
<li>Show how a few consecutive bytes of RAM can store a string of ASCII
codes.</li>
<li>Do a couple of math problems using two adjacent bytes as (binary)
operands and another byte to store the result.</li>
<li>Move a couple of bytes from one area in the RAM to another.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Addresses, numbers, operations, naming. (microcode)<a class="headerlink" href="#addresses-numbers-operations-naming-microcode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Wonder at the beauty and greatness of what we&#8217;ve done so far. We mapped
binary digits (bits) to real world phenomenon. We used a simple coding
system, algebra in base two, to encode the integers into bit patterns. We
created a &#8220;strip&#8221; or &#8220;column&#8221; of bits, organized in eight-bit-wide words
called bytes or octets, and then numbered those, counted them to name
them, and began to use this abacus-like crude machine of ours to perform
simple operations like math, logic, and &#8220;string&#8221; manipulation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-power-of-naming">
<h2>The Power of Naming<a class="headerlink" href="#the-power-of-naming" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Start to make the steps used to perform these operations more concrete.
Use index cards or something and list out the various steps you take in
performing a few simple math/logic problems and stuff.</p>
<p>Do the counting-to-name-things trick yet again to enumerate the
&#8220;microcode&#8221; you&#8217;ve developed, and lay in a simple program using it.</p>
<p>Act out the Fetch-Execute cycle and let people get used to the idea of
how simple it is. Maybe even assign each instruction of microcode to a
different person and have the class cooperatively act out the solving of
a simple math problem or two according to an in-memory machine language
program. (That will prove viscerally that you don&#8217;t need a brain or mind
to &#8220;be&#8221; a computer. Put another way, some classes of mental operation can
be automated, carried out by machine.)</p>
<p>(You would also introduce the idea that RAM can be a lot larger than just
a dozen bytes or so, and likely mention registers too.)</p>
