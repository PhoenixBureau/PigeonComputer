This is the original META-II system, with the ASM, the grammar, and a VM
written in Python.  The only changes are that the '|' char is used for
alternation and the semi-colon (rather than '.,') is used to terminate
statements.  You can regenerate the ASM file with e.g.:

    ./metaii.py -p metaii.asm metaii.metaii > metaii.out
