Each term examines the stack on entry. if false, the word exits immediately with false on the stack.



|| given a true value on the stack, exits the colon definition immediately with true on the stack.

&& given a false value on the stack, exits the colon definition immediately with false on the stack.

We assume that each "token" (terminal) is represented by a Forth word which scans the input stream and 
returns a success flag.
