Xerblin Base
=================================

This module builds a Xerblin system out of purely "Functional" parts.

An interpreter is represented by a two-tuple that holds a stack and a
dictionary.

The stack is a sort of linked list structure while the dictionary is a
BTree that maps string names to four kinds of entries:

Functions - These must accept an interpreter, modify it somehow, and
return the modified interpreter.  They are defined in the library
module.

Or, one of three kinds of tuple.  The kind of the tuple is indicated
by its first member, which is a handler function, and the rest of the
tuple consists in its body as indicated:

    (SEQUENCE HANDLER, func0, func1, func2)
    
    (BRANCH HANDLER, true_func, false_func)
    
    (LOOP HANDLER, func0, func1, func2)

where any of the functions can be themselves SEQ, BRANCH, LOOP, or
plain functions as described above.

Interpretation is done by means of an apply_func(interpreter, function)
function that knows how to deal with the above combo-word tuples as well
as library word functions.

The first three functions defined in this module are used to build
"combo" commands in the UI.  There are corresponding commands in the
library (NewSeqWord, NewLoopWord, and NewBranchWord) that build tuples
with these functions as the first item in the tuple.  When apply_func()
encounters these tuples the initial handler function is used to "run" the
other functions in the tuple.

The three functions are:

    handle_sequence

    handle_branch

    handle_loop

The apply_func() function is used by the handlers and the interpret()
function to "run" commands on the interpreter.
