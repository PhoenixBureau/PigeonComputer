'''
BTree
=================================

This is a simple Binary Tree implementation that uses tuples in such a
way as to permit "persistant" usage, i.e. all previous versions of the
btree datastructures are retained and available (provided you don't throw
them away yourself.)

The empty tree is represented as an empty tuple.  Nodes are a tuple
consisting of a key, a value, and two (possible empty) sub-nodes for the
lower and higher branches of the tree.

This module defines the following functions:

    insert(node, key, value)

    get(node, key)

    delete(node, key)

Both insert() and delete() return a new tuple that is the result of
applying the operation to the existing node.  (And both get() and delete()
will raise KeyErrors if the key is not in the tree.)

Because of the way that insert() and delete() are written, only as much
of the tree is changed as necessary and the rest of it is reused. This
provides persistance without using up memory for each version of the
tree.

These functions are implemented recursively so they have the potential to
raise a RuntimeError if the maximum recursion depth is exceeded.  This
should only be a problem if used with very large trees.  To avoid this
issue you can use sys.setrecursionlimit(), but I think I might just
rewrite these to not use recursion.

Xerblin Base
=================================

This module builds a Xerblin system out of purely "Functional" parts.

An interpreter is represented by a two-tuple that holds a stack and a
dictionary.

The stack is a sort of linked list structure while the dictionary is a
BTree that maps string names to four kinds of entries:

Functions - These must accept an interpreter, modify it somehow, and
return the modified interpreter.  They are defined in the library
module.

Or, one of three kinds of tuple.  The kind of the tuple is indicated
by its first member, which is a handler function, and the rest of the
tuple consists in its body as indicated:

    (handle_sequence, func0, func1, func2, ...)

    (handle_branch, true_func, false_func)

    (handle_loop, func0, func1, func2, ...)

where any of the functions can be themselves SEQ, BRANCH, LOOP, or
plain functions as described above.

Interpretation is done by means of an apply_func(interpreter, function)
function that knows how to deal with the above combo-word tuples as well
as library word functions.

The first three functions defined in this module are used to build
"combo" commands in the UI.  There are corresponding commands in the
library (NewSeqWord, NewLoopWord, and NewBranchWord) that build tuples
with these functions as the first item in the tuple.  When apply_func()
encounters these tuples the initial handler function is used to "run" the
other functions in the tuple.

The three functions are:

    handle_sequence

    handle_branch

    handle_loop

The apply_func() function is used by the handlers and the interpret()
function to "run" commands on the interpreter.

World
=================================

This module defines two classes: Serializer and World. Serializer deals
with saving history protocols to a pickle file and World deals with
interacting with an interpreter in a loop.

This module also defines a subclass of World called HistoryListWorld that
tracks history in a list object, and a couple of very basic views.

Starting with an initial interpreter (comprised of a stack of nominal
data and a dictionary of commands and possibly named state "variables")
the user issues a command to the interpreter which then results in a new
state (which can be the same as the initial state.)

The interpreter is embedded in a frame (a World or subclass) which
provides view and history and serialization controls.

These frame "meta" controls are several:

Change the view function.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

View functions take a state (interpreter, stack and dictionary) and
render it somehow for the user.

Implied but not necessary are means for direct manipulation of views
to send commands to the interpreter.  It may well turn out that tight
feedback loops between views and modeled states will require a
relaxation of the strict functional style I'm striving for here.

In any event, views take a state and render it.

Views may render as text in a terminal or GUI text widget, "direct"
graphics via Pygame, etc., GUI systems such as Tkinter or wxPython,
document formats like Postscript or PDF, graphs using matplotlib or
other libraries in formats such as PNG or SVG, or web UIs using HTML,
CSS, Javascript, and perhaps even ActionScript (Flash).

Examine history and change to previous states.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The chief advantage of storing all history is in the ease of going
back and trying something new from a previous point in time.

This requires some means of indexing and displaying the states in
your history and your path through them so you can decide when to go
back to, and a way to actually go back and set your current state to
a previous state and add the transition to the history.

This seems to require another kind of view that can display not just
one state time-slice of your history, but also the tree-like path
from state to state you took.

(There is an infinite regression here: do you keep the history of the
changing of the history?  What about the history of the keeping of
that history, do you keep that too?  And that keeping's history?
Etc...  In practice we are likely to make do with only one level of
history.)

In addition to simply stepping back and forth in time, we will also
want to "pull" data from different history states, possibly in
multiple stored pickle files, and combine them in a new synthesized
states.  We can build new interpreters with the data and commands we
need to perform tasks and achieve our goals.

As yet, this script provides only indirect means to manipulate and view
history.  You can use a HistoryListWorld and manipulate its history
attribute, which is a list containing all the states of the system in
order starting with the initial state.

Manipulate external save files.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The histories must be stored in python pickle files in some external
media (i.e. a disk drive or memory stick) and there are issues of
selecting and loading histories and managing the relations between
them.

Currently this script provides no direct means to do any of this.

You can pass a file name or open file object to the World as its
save_file argument and that will be used to save the pickle data as
you use the World object, but other than that you're on your own.

class Serializer:
    '''
    Combines a Pickler and a file or file-like object to track a linear
    protocol of state -> command -> resultant-state history.

    You instantiate it with an initial state (i.e. your "root" stack and
    dictionary) and a file(-like object) to save to then you call post()
    repeatedly with the next command and the resultant stack and
    dictionary.

    The Pickler keeps a memo dict of the objects it has seen and pickled
    already and when it sees them again it serializes a reference to them
    rather than the whole object, automatically providing a sort of
    compression for the persistant datastructures we're storing in the
    pickle stream.

    You can open the pickle file and call load() repeatedly to get a
    sequence of state, command, state, ...  There will always be an odd
    number of stored data: the initial state followed by zero or more
    pairs of command and result state.
