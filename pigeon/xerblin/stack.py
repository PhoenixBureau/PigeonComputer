Stack
=================================

Tuple-based persistent stack.

This is too simple to document.  It's almost too simple to implement.

def push(stack, *items):
    '''Push arguments onto a stack.'''
    for item in items:
        stack = item, stack # push
    return stack

    '''Pop number arguments from stack.'''
    for _ in range(number):
        item, stack = stack # pop
        yield item
    yield stack

    '''Iterate through the items on the stack.'''

        item, stack = stack
        yield item


def lenStack(stack):
    '''Return the number of items on the stack.'''
    return sum(1 for _ in iterStack(stack))


def pick_(stack, n):
    '''
    Find the nth item on the stack and duplicate it to TOS. (Pick with
    zero is the same as "dup".)
    '''
