Pigeon Computer
===============

Simple computer system built around ATmega328P microcontroller.

Right now there is just a simple assembler, written in Python, for the AVR
assembly language.  It is built along the ideas of Miki Tebeka  and his
fascinating [Python based assembler][1] although with a slightly
different architecture.  The basic trick of interpreting a python file
in a special context to get parsing &c. for free is the same.
