Pigeon Computer
============================================

The Pigeon Computer is a simple computer based on the popular
`ATmega328P`_ microcontroller.  It has a set of software tools
(including an assembler, a simple but powerful compiler, and a
development environment) that are all written in Python and easy
to understand.

It is designed to support a course on the foundational concepts of
computing and programming.  After learning how to use the Pigeon
Computer system you will be able to build and program your own robots
and other cool electronic devices, and you will be extremely well
prepared for courses on computers and programming languages like C++
and Java.

Not only is this really fun but it is direct and valuable preparation
for a career in programming, electronics, and IT in general.  It teaches
you the "ABC's" of computation in a way that is relevant to everyone.

**THIS IS STILL A DRAFT DOCUMENT** There are loose ends and missing bits
and things that might not makes sense without more explanation.
