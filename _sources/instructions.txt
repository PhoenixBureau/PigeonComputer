Appendix B: Supported Assembly Instructions
============================================

Currently forty-three instructions are implemented.

It's not hard to add the rest, it's just those are the ones I needed
to get the firmware running.



The following instructions are implemented so far:

* add
* adiw
* andi
* brcc
* breq
* brlo
* brne
* brsh
* cli
* clr
* cp
* cpc
* cpi
* cpse
* dec
* ijmp
* inc
* jmp
* ld_post_incr
* ld_pre_decr
* ldi
* lds
* lpm
* lpm_post_incr
* lsl
* lsr
* mov
* movw
* mul
* or_
* out
* pop
* push
* rcall
* ret
* rjmp
* sbiw
* sbrs
* sei
* st_post_incr
* sts
* subi
